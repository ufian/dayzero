# Dayzero

Dayzero is a lightweight macOS menu bar clock inspired by the elegant yet now unavailable [Day-O](https://shauninman.com/archive/2011/10/20/day_o_mac_menu_bar_clock) project by [Shaun Inman](https://github.com/shauninman).

It is built entirely in Swift using SwiftUI.

## ðŸŒŸ Motivation

Dayzero was created to revive the simplicity and charm of Day-O, which is no longer compatible with modern macOS versions. By leveraging the power of SwiftUI and incorporating AI-assisted development tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, this project aims to modernize and refine the original concept while making it freely available to the open-source community.
